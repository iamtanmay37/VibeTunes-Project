# VibeTunes:🎵

**Live App:** [Click here to use the App](https://vibetunes-project-qv9fbcndkevrrkyrisenmt.streamlit.app/)

## About the Project
VibeTunes is a Python web app I built for my college project. It is a music recommender that helps you find songs based on your mood. I focused on Indian music (Bollywood, DHH, and Indie) because standard apps often ignore these genres in their "mood" playlists.

## Features
* **Two ways to use it:** Select a mood from the menu OR type how you are feeling in the text box.
* **Moods Detected:** Happy, Sad, Energetic (Gym), Relaxed, Romantic, and Angry.
* **Song Library:** Includes artists like KR$NA, Arijit Singh, Seedhe Maut, and Prateek Kuhad.
* **Instant Play:** Provides direct links to listen on YouTube.

## Tech Stack
* **Python:** Used for all the logic.
* **Streamlit:** Used to build the user interface.
* **Hosting:** Deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud.
